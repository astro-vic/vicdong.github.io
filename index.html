                <p>Howdy! I'm a PhD student studying astronomy and astrophysics at Northwestern University, working with Dr. Wen-fai Fong at CIERA. My research focuses on understanding the most extreme explosions in the universe - fast radio bursts (FRBs).</p>
                
                <p>I'm broadly interested in understanding the origin and evolution of cosmic transients and their environments. My graduate studies focus on uncovering the physical origins of fast radio bursts using multi-wavelength observations of their local and global environments.</p>
                
                <p>I am also an active member of scientific collaborations including the Fast and Fortunate for FRB Follow-up (F4) collaboration and CHIME/FRB. When I'm not in the office, I enjoy running, hiking, visiting national parks, and reading.</p>

            <p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond radio transients with high dispersion measures (DM) that implies an extragalactic origin. A small fraction of FRBs are known to repeat, ruling out a cataclysmic origin for at least a subset of FRBs. FRBs are hard to study, especially when they are hard to localize and have no multi-wavelength counterparts.</p>

              <p>The prevailing progenitor model for FRBs is magnetars which are predominantly formed from the core-collapse of massive stars. Therefore, FRBs are expected to be associated with supernovae (SNe). I built a framework for rapidly associating all optical transients from the Transient Name Server (TNS) and the first sample of CHIME-KKO Outrigger FRBs.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                  <p> The discovery of a persistent radio source (PRS) coincident with the first FRB 20121102A
                    revealed a compact and energetic source in a dwarf galaxy, offering one of the first clues to their origins. 
                    Motivated by this connection, I carried out new multi-frequency VLA and EVN observations of PRSs in dwarf galaxies 
                    that are offset from their galactic centers. I identified one particularly promising FRB–PRS candidate based on its compact size and location, 
                    with properties consistent with models of neutron star wind nebulae or hypernebulae. 
                    This work underscores the diversity of PRSs in dwarf galaxies and the challenges in distinguishing true FRB-associated PRSs from background active galactic nuclei.</p>

                  <p>FRB 20201124A is one of the most active repeaters ever observed. Surprisingly, the FRB sits in a region without any obvious optical signs of star formation. 
                   Using both VLA and HST observations, my work revealed hidden, dust-obscured star formation reaching all the way to the FRB’s position.
                   This hints at a magnetar born right where it lives. We also placed some of the deepest limits yet on any persistent radio emission, consistent with models of magnetar wind nebulae and hypernebulae. </p>

          <h3>Ca-rich Transients</h3>
          <p>Calcium-rich (Ca-rich) transients are a newly recognized class of supernovae (SNe) with peculiar characteristics. They have a defining feature of strong calcium line emissions thirty days after explosion and may be a significant driver of chemical evolution in the intracluster medium (ISM). However, their progenitor systems remain unknown.</p>
          
          <p>I worked with Dr. Dan Milisavljevic to characterize the stellar populations of their host galaxies using broadband photometry.

          <h3>Short Gamma-ray Bursts</h3>
          <p>Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are systems that produce gravitational waves when two neutron stars merge somewhere in the local Universe. A way to understand the formation and evolution of these BNS mergers is through short-duration γ-ray bursts (sGRBs) as they have long been connected with one another.</p>
          
          <p>I worked with Dr. Wen-fai Fong and Dr. Anya Nugent as a research fellow and examined the host galaxies of a small sample of sGRBs by looking at the galaxy characteristics such as age, mass, and metallicity. I fit for the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the host galaxies using a parametric model that describes a delayed-tau star formation history.</p>
