                <p>Howdy! I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow at CIERA, Northwestern University, working with Dr. Wen-fai Fong.</p>
                
                <p>I'm broadly interested in understanding the origin and evolution of cosmic transients and their environments. My graduate studies focus on uncovering the physical origins of fast radio bursts using multi-wavelength observations of their local and global environments.</p>
                
                <p>I am also an active member of scientific collaborations including the Fast and Fortunate for FRB Follow-up (F4) collaboration and CHIME/FRB.</p>
                
                <p>When I'm not in the office, I enjoy running, hiking, visiting national parks, and reading :)</p>

            <p class="research-intro">Throughout my research career so far, I have been lucky enough to work with many flavors of time-domain transients. Below are the ones I've had the opportunity to work on, but please don't hesitate to reach out for collaborations on other cool transients!</p>

          <h3>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)</h3>
          <p>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond radio transients with high dispersion measures (DM) that implies an extragalactic origin. A small fraction of FRBs are known to repeat, ruling out a cataclysmic origin for at least a subset of FRBs. FRBs are hard to study, especially when they are hard to localize and have no multi-wavelength counterparts.</p>
          
          <p>I joined the <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucolick.org/f-4/" target="_blank">Fast and Fortunate FRB Follow-up (F4)</a> collaboration in 2021 to study FRB sources on the observational side.</p>
          
          <p>I started a crossmatching project with <a href="https://ciera.northwestern.edu/directory/charlie-kilpatrick/" target="_blank">Dr. Charlie Kilpatrick</a> on FRBs. This project aims to build an infrastructure on rapidly associating current and future FRBs detections to any and all associated transients, narrowing down the list of potential host galaxies if it originates from one without having precise localization.</p>

          <h3>Ca-rich Transients (2018 – 2021)</h3>
          <p>Calcium-rich (Ca-rich) transients are a newly recognized class of supernovae (SNe) with peculiar characteristics. They have a defining feature of strong calcium line emissions thirty days after explosion and may be a significant driver of chemical evolution in the intracluster medium (ISM). However, their progenitor systems remain unknown.</p>
          
          <p>I worked with Dr. Dan Milisavljevic to characterize the stellar populations of their host galaxies using broadband photometry. The analysis was done using <a href="https://github.com/bd-j/prospector" target="_blank">Prospector</a>, a Python package that specializes in stellar population inferences.</p>

          <h3>Short Gamma-ray Bursts (2020 – 2021)</h3>
          <p>Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are systems that produce gravitational waves when two neutron stars merge somewhere in the local Universe. A way to understand the formation and evolution of these BNS mergers is through short-duration γ-ray bursts (sGRBs) as they have long been connected with one another.</p>
          
          <p>I worked with Dr. Wen-fai Fong and graduate student Anya Nugent as a research fellow and examined the host galaxies of a small sample of sGRBs by looking at the galaxy characteristics such as age, mass, and metallicity. I fit for the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the host galaxies using a parametric model that describes a delayed-tau star formation history.</p>
