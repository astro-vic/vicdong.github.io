          <div class="frb-overview">
            <p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are incredibly bright, millisecond-long radio flashes with dispersion measures that imply an extragalactic origin. 
              Only a small fraction (4%) of FRBs are known to repeat, while most appear as one-off events. Despite the rapidly growing sample of FRBs, the nature of their progenitors
              still remain enigmatic, especially when they are hard to localize and have no multi-wavelength counterparts.</p>

              <h4 class="subsection-title"> FRB-Optical Transient Crossmatching</h4>
              <p>The leading progenitor model for FRBs involves magnetars, which are often born from the core-collapse of massive stars.
                If this connection holds true, some FRBs should be associated with supernovae (SNe). 
                In my most recent work, I built a framework to systematically crossmatch all SNe and optical transients reported to the Transient Name Server (TNS) 
                with the first sample of CHIME-KKO Outrigger FRBs to directly test this idea. <p>
                
               <p>  Although we did not find any significant spatial or redshift matches, we quantified the significance of future associations and explored the transparentcy timescale after 
                which FRBs can escape their local dense plasma environments.
                Building on this, I am developing an automated system to identify potential optical counterparts to CHIME FRBs through the CHIME/FRB Slack alert network.
                This effort comes at a particularly exciting time, as the Rubin Observatory’s LSST will soon enable the discovery of optical transients at an unprecedented rate, 
                bringing us closer than ever to identifying an FRB-SN connection!

                <div class="text-content">
                  <p> The first repeating FRB 20121102A revealed a surprising compact, persistent radio source (PRS) counterpart in a dwarf galaxy, offset from its center.
                      The leading explanation is that a compact neutron star powers a synchrotron nebula, producing the observed radio emission.
                      Because the origins of both PRSs and FRBs are still uncertain, we set out to investigate whether PRSs could serve as signposts for FRBs. To date, 
                    five FRB-PRSs have been discovered, most reside in dwarf galaxies and all are repeating FRBs. </p>

                  </p> Using observations from VLA and EVN, we studied a sample of off-nuclear PRSs in nearby dwarf galaxies. Among them, we identified 
                  one source as the most promising FRB-PRS candidate, J1136+2643, distinguished by its compact size and galactocentric offset. While other sources 
                  may also be FRB-PRSs, some are likely background AGN. Comparing our data to models of neutron star wind nebulae and hypernebulae, 
                  we found that the radio properties of J1136+2643 are consistent with both scenarios.

                      </p>
                  <p> This work highlights the diversity of PRSs in dwarf galaxies, the flexibility of current FRB progenitor models, 
                    and the observational challenges in distinguishing true FRB-associated PRSs from interlopers.</p>

                  <p>FRB 20201124A is one of the most active repeaters ever observed, yet it sits in a region without any obvious optical signs of star formation. 
                   Using VLA and HST observations, we mapped the location and morphology of star formation throughout the host and searched for a PRS
                   coincident with the FRB.

          <h3>Ca-rich Transients</h3>
          <p> Calcium-rich (Ca-rich) transients are a quirky class of supernovae, known for their rapid evolution,
             modest brightness, and strong calcium emission lines. Despite these distinctive features, their progenitors are 
             still debated. Interestingly, nearly half are found in the outskirts of mostly elliptical galaxies, 
             hinting at a connection to older stellar populations rather than massive young stars. <p>


             </p> As an undergraduate at Purdue, I worked with Prof. Dan Milisavljevic to get at the progenitor question
            through their environments. We compiled archival multi-wavelength observations for a sample of Ca-rich transients and used the stellar
             population modeling tool Prospector to study their host properties. For nine host galaxies, we were able to construct detailed
             star formation histories, which we used to determine supernova rates and assess whether each transient likely
             originated from a core-collapse or Type Ia-like explosion.</p>

             <p>Our results suggest that Ca-rich transients don't exclusively come from core-collapse SNe. Instead, they likely arise either from white dwarfs
              or a mixed population including both white dwarfs and massive stars. I had a lot of fun (and growing pains) learning (spectral energy distribution) SED fitting and stellar population analysis 
              through this project and was my first dive into the world of transients!

                  a more sophisticated non-parametric model. The Prospector models capture the data well across all wavelengths, 
                  allowing robust estimates of the host galaxy’s properties.

          <h3>sGRBs</h3>
